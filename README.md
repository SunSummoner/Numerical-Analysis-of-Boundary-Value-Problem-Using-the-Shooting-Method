# Numerical-Analysis-of-Boundary-Value-Problem-Using-the-Shooting-Method

This is project I did under Dr. Sonam Tanwar during the course of my Partial Differential Equations (PDE) paper.
Shooting method is a numerical method used for numerical analysis of boundary value problems by using the given boundary conditions to “shoot” an initial condition with satisfies those boundary conditions. It involves finding a solution initial condition for different initial value problems until we find the solution which also satisfies the boundary conditions of the boundary value problem. In other words, we shoot out trajectories in different directions towards a particular boundary condition until we find an initial condition that hits it. Hence, its name the shooting method.
